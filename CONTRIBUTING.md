## Adding a tool MCP server

MCP servers are implemented using [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome). There are three functionalities of the MCP server: tools, resources, and prompts.

- Tools are used for generating information beyond the capabilities of the LLM.
- Resources are used for providing read-only information either statically or dynamically generated by the server.
- Prompts are preformatted user instructions.

You can add new tools by creating a directory under `src/molmcp/tools/`. Using `smiley-mcp` as an example, the general structure is as follows:

``` sh
smileymcp
├── __init__.py
├── server.py
├── smileslib
└── tools.py
```

- `server.py` contains server construction and `main()` entry point
- `tools.py` contains tool definitions and tool registry function
- `smileslib` is a submodule and contains all of the actual logic behind the tool definitions

Add the server to  `src/molmcp/__init__.py` with a name to have it appear in the CLI.
```python
TOOLS: dict[str, FastMCP[Any]] = {
    "smiles": smileymcp.mcp,
    "my-new-server": mynewserver.mcp,
}
```

After adding the server, add the entry point under `[project.scripts]` in the `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
[project.scripts]
smls-mcp = "molmcp.tools.smileymcp.server:main"
```

Then, you can run your server via `uv run`.
```sh
uv run smls-mcp
```

## Adding an agent

I'm moving away from fast-agent to pydantic-ai, so this is still a work in progress!
